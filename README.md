# Start
`npm install`

- `gulp img-min` :: losslessly optimize files in `src` directory to `dist` directory. Files cannot be optimized will be copied to `dist` directory
- `gulp img-min-rename` :: the same as above and replace spaces with hyphens and lowercase the file basename and extension name
- `gulp myscss` :: compile myscss `**/myscss/*.scss`
- `gulp myvendorsjs` :: minimize vendor js files
    - `node_modules/owl.carousel/owl.carousel.js` are saved to `assets/js/owl.carousel/owl.carousel.js` and `assets/js/owl.carousel/owl.carousel.min.js` (generated by this Gulp). `assets/js/owl.carouse` is taken from original js file base name `owl.carousel`
- `gulp watch` only does `gulp myscss` for now..
